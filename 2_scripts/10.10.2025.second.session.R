#Practical session 1



films <- read.csv('1_data/films.csv')

# Question 1
# Download the file films_2.csv from Moodle, and create an object called films that contains the data from this file.
# 

# Question 2
# (2a) Find out how many rows and columns there are. (2b) What are the column names?
#   
dim(films)
colnames(films)
#   Question 3
# Find the number of votes for elements 35 to 70 in the dataset.

# 
# Question 4
# What is the class of the column numVotes?
#

#   Question 5
# Using the sum and length function, find the mean number of votes across all entries. Does this agree with the answer that you get with the mean function?
#   
mean.votes.0 <- sum(films$numVotes)/length(films$numVotes)

# Find the mean of each numeric column â€“ average rating, number of votes and start year.
# 
#
