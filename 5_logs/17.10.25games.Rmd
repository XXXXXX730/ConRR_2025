# Main Heading

This template should help you with the basics of R Markdown: text, code "chunks", in-line code, plots and tables. It is easy to make lists, for example

 - Make a list
 - Check it twice
 - Find out who's naughty and nice
 - Come to town

Here is some text: just type the same way as you would type in Word. Directly below this text, there is a code "chunk", where you can type R code:

```{r}

# This is a chunk: your R code goes in here just like a regular R script:

scores <- c(5, 3, 6, 8, 10)
m <- mean(scores)
m
```

## Sub-heading: chunk options 

By default, knitr will show both your code and the output in the resulting document. You can use chunk options to change this behaviour. They work like R command arguments. First, tell knitr to not show the code, by using `echo=FALSE`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
scores <- c(5, 3, 6, 8, 10)
the.mean <- mean(scores)
the.mean
```

Second, tell knitr to not show the output, using `results='hide`:

```{r,  results='hide'}
scores <- c(5, 3, 6, 8, 10)
the.mean <- mean(scores)
the.mean
```

You can also tell knitr to not run the code at all, using `eval=FALSE`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
scores10 <- c(5, 3, 6, 8, 10, 3, 6, 12, 4, 9)
mean(scores10)
```

Instead of setting these options in every chunk, you can set options at the beginning that will then be in place for every chunk. We call this a "global" chunk option, and we do this in the very first chunk in this document where we set `echo=TRUE` using the line `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`.

A useful aspect of R Markdown is that, in the text, you can use objects that you've created inside the chunks. For example, the mean of `scores` is `r the.mean`. You can even run little bits of code inside the text: the sum of the five scores is `r sum(scores)`, for example.


## Sub-heading: plots

You can run code that creates plots, and knitr will show them by default:

```{r}
myplot <- ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=cut, y=price, fill=color)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set3")
myplot
```

### Sub-sub-heading: chunk options for plots

There are also chunk options that let you alter your plot, such as specifying the dimensions:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=4}
myplot
```


## Tables

### kable: for basic tables

The `kable` command is a fast way to create tables. Here is the simple output of R without using any commands:

```{r}
tab <- head(diamonds[, 1:7])
tab
```

Now using `kable`:

```{r}
kable(tab)
```

The `kable` command has arguments for altering how the table looks, including changing the column names, alignment, captions, rounding, and more.

```{r}
better.colnames <- c("Carat", "Cut", "Colour", "Clarity", "Depth(%)", "Relative width", "Price($)")
better.tab <- kable(tab,
      col.names = better.colnames,
      align = c("rcccrrr"),
      caption = "My sensible caption")
better.tab
```
