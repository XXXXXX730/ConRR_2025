# **Exploratory assignment for ConRR in MPhil PHS 2025-2026**

## **Introduction**

In this exploratory assignment, the plan is to form a markdown document to be published on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) containing:

-   Plots
-   Tables
-   Multiple R markdown code chuncks
-   An External Image
-   Inline codes
-   A table of contents
-   A Code Download button
-   Headings and subheadings
-   A list (like this one)
-   A hyperlink

## **Steps**

```{r PPADC figure, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = 'PPADC.JPG') # An image on the PPADCs cycle 
```

As it has been described in the PPDAC [@lukman2022] frame work, the following steps will be executed:

1.  Defining the *problem*?
    -   Most analysis and result presentation in medical research is tedious and error-prone due the nature of the research, where research questions get re-framed and tailored as the research rolls. This makes instantaneous updating of the documents and version-control very difficult.

<!-- -->

2.  The *plan* that will be used to approach the above problem.
    -   An important lecture was given on way of reporting that weaves the analysis and results of a research, keeping along the dynamics of data, analysis and results throughout the life of a project. The plan is to practice this in a sample of data from the lecture. To further illustrate the plan;
        -   Data will be imported.

        -   Nature of the data will be examined.

        -   Exploration of the data will be underwent.

        -   Report based on the data set will be written.

        -   Changes will be made to the analysis according information obtained in first place.

        -   We will see how we undergo changes through the document on one go while keeping track the older version.

<!-- -->

3.  *Data* will be imported and cleaned for the above plan.

    -   The data set given work on is on board games. And it will be used to undergo the above mentioned plan.

4.  *Analysis* will be carried out to practice how to make a life-long reproducible document.

5.  *Discussion* will be formulated on the experience gained and how this will be used in the future.

6.  *Conclusion* will be done and further analysis and questions to be '*PPDACed'* will be put forth.


### **Loading and Cleaning the data**

#### ***Importing Data***

The dataset is put in the project file's sub folder called `1_data` inside the project directory.

The chunck option `cache=` will be set to `TRUE` to avoid future loading of data, unless there is change to the data set games.csv.This made by `cache.extra=file.mtime('1_data/games.csv')`. This saves time and memory.



```{r loading the dataset, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, cache=TRUE, cache.extra=file.mtime('1_data/games.csv')}

board.games <- rio::import(here('1_data/games.csv')) # Saving the imported data on the object refereed by board.games


```

“*Time moves in one direction, memory in another.*”

— William Gibson


#### ***Opening the box***

```{r initial exploration of the datat set }
skim.board.games<- skim(board.games) 
skim.board.games

```

Second, tell knitr to not show the output, using `results='hide`:

####***Getting Target varialbes and checking summary of them***


```{r Numerical variables summary}

numerical.col <- c(    # Isolating the numberical variables for anaylsis
  'max_players',	
  'max_playtime',	
  'min_age',
  'min_players',
  'min_playtime',
  'playing_time',	
  'year_published',	
  'average_rating',
  'users_rated'
  )                   

numerical.board.games <- board.games[,c('compilation',numerical.col)]

head(numerical.board.games)     # Checking if we have the right columns with right setup
```



### **Analysis**

In this section we will build some plots using `ggplot2()`

```{r boardgames visualization, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}



ggplot(data = numerical.board.games, mapping = aes(x = year_published, 
                                          y = users_rated,
                                         )
       ) + 
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    title = 'UsersRating by year of publication',
     x = 'Year of publication',
     y = 'User Rated',
     caption= 'Source: Games.csv - \'Learning to report\''
    )+
  theme_minimal()

```
And lets build a table that summarize numerical values.

```{r kable table of summary of the data}

kable(summary(numerical.board.games))

```


### **Discussion**

```{r average}

average.max.player <- mean(numerical.board.games$max_playtime)
```

The mean of the maximum play time in the `games` data set was `r average average.max.player` players.


```{r}
# better.colnames <- c("Carat", "Cut", "Colour", "Clarity", "Depth(%)", "Relative width", "Price($)")
# better.tab <- kable(tab,
#       col.names = better.colnames,
#       align = c("rcccrrr"),
#       caption = "My sensible caption")
# better.tab
```
